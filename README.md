# Duke-Learn-To-Program
Contains codes implemented during the Duke Learn to Program (Java) Specialization on Coursera

• Will include mini-projects too.

• Unfortunately, code from week 1 to 3 of course 1 was lost and is not available here. A good resource for the same is the very site hosted by Duke University: http://www.dukelearntoprogram.com/

• Check this for additional resources and more project implementations.

• All HTML projects were created codepen.io.
